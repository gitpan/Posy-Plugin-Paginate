Revision history for Posy-Plugin-Paginate
=========================================

0.25 Sun 10 July 2005
---------------------

  * (10 Jul 2005) added pageinate_param_name config
  	The new paginate_param_name config variable enables one to change
  the name of the parameter which is used to designate page numbers. The
  default is 'page', but it can be useful to be able to change it if it
  conflicts with something else.

0.24 Fri 13 May 2005
--------------------

  * (13 May 2005) current page
  	Now indicates which page is the current page in the $page_list;
  it no longer has a link, and the page-number is in bold.

  * (13 May 2005) make things work better with hybrid sites
  	Added 'paginate_url' config variable, and changed the paginate
  links so that for hybrid sites, the CGI script will still be called,
  even if the link is from a static page.
  	This doesn't work with the Cannonical plugin, though.

0.23 Thu 12 May 2005
--------------------

  * (12 May 2005) update Posy version

  * (12 May 2005) add Makefile.PL

0.22 Sat 09 April 2005
----------------------

  * (9 Apr 2005) added page-list
  	Now one can use $flow_paginate_page_list to get a list of *all*
  the pages, not just previous and next.

0.21 Sun 06 February 2005
-------------------------

  * (6 Feb 2005) added INSTALL docs

0.20 Fri 28 January 2005
------------------------

  * (28 Jan 2005) removed Makefile.PL

  * (28 Jan 2005) fixed so will work with FindGrep
  	Or with other things that set the query string.
  Now it reproduces the current query string (altering 'page' param)
  when building its next and prev links.

0.10 Sun 16 January 2005
------------------------

  * (16 Jan 2005) teething troubles

  * (16 Jan 2005) initial checkin
