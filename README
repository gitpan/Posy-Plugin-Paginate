==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::Paginate - Posy plugin to paginate multiple entries.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.21'' of Posy::Plugin::Paginate.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This plugin enables categories or chronological listsing with multiple
entries in them, to be broken up into a number of pages, with previous and
next links. Page length is defined by the 'num_entries' configuration
setting; it will select entries depending on the 'page' parameter.

This provides the following variables that can be used within your flavour
files.

``flow_paginate_prev_link''
Contains a link to the previous page, and is empty if this link is not
valid.

``flow_paginate_next_link''
Contains a link to the next page, and is empty if this link is not valid.


==   Activation   ==

This plugin needs to be added to both the plugins list and the actions list.

In the actions list, 'filter_by_page' needs to go somewhere after
``sort_entries'' and before ``head_render'', since the entries need to have
been sorted, and the selection needs to be done before the head template is
rendered, so that links could be put in the head part of the page if
required.


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the
config directory.

``paginate_prev_label''
The label for the "prev" link. (default: '&lt;&lt;- prev')

``paginate_next_label''
The label for the "next" link. (default: 'next -&gt;&gt;')


==== INSTALLATION ====

Installation needs will vary depending on the particular setup a person has.


==   Administrator, Automatic   ==

If you are the administrator of the system, then the dead simple method of
installing the modules is to use the CPAN or CPANPLUS system.

    cpanp -i Posy::Plugin::Paginate

This will install this plugin in the usual places where modules get
installed when one is using CPAN(PLUS).


==   Administrator, By Hand   ==

If you are the administrator of the system, but don't wish to use the
CPAN(PLUS) method, then this is for you. Take the *.tar.gz file and untar it
in a suitable directory.

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install


==   User With Shell Access   ==

If you are a user on a system, and don't have root/administrator access, you
need to install Posy somewhere other than the default place (since you don't
have access to it). However, if you have shell access to the system, then
you can install it in your home directory.

Say your home directory is "/home/fred", and you want to install the modules
into a subdirectory called "perl".

Download the *.tar.gz file and untar it in a suitable directory.

    perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to find
the modules, and the PATH variable to find the scripts (posy_one,
posy_static).

Therefore you will need to change: your path, to include
/home/fred/perl/script (where the script will be)

        PATH=/home/fred/perl/script:${PATH}

the PERL5LIB variable to add /home/fred/perl/lib

        PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
